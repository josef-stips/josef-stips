## ðŸŽ® My Biggest Project: ComplexToe  

One of my proudest achievements is **[ComplexToe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2940750/ComplexToe/)**, a strategy game now available on Steam.  
I worked independently on this project for 1.5 years, managing everything from concept and design to development and testing. (I had some idea-help from friends)
